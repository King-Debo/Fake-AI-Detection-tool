# Fake AI Content Detection Program

## Purpose

This program is a web application that can detect different types of fake AI content, such as deepfake videos, images, text, voice, music, and other types of synthetic media. It uses state-of-the-art deep learning models and techniques to classify fake AI content and provide some explanation or evidence for the detection.

## Features

- The program allows users to upload or input any type of media file, such as .mp4, .avi, .mov, .jpg, .png, .txt, .wav, .mp3, .mid, etc.
- The program displays the results of the fake AI content detection in a user-friendly and interactive way, such as a pie chart that shows the probability of the media being fake or real, and a table that shows the type of fake AI content (if any) and some explanation or evidence for the detection.
- The program supports different types of fake AI content detection, such as:
  - FaceForensics++ for detecting deepfake videos or images of faces
  - Grover for detecting fake text generated by GPT-2 or GPT-3 models
  - DeFakeHop for detecting fake voice generated by WaveNet or WaveRNN models
  - FakeCatcher for detecting fake music generated by Jukebox or MuseNet models
